Hi, I am Xu Jian, a master's graduate in Communication and Information Systems from the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China**.<br>

With over three years of experience as a software development engineer at [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/) and [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/), I have strong coding skills and the ability to implement solutions efficiently. Recently, I worked as a research assistant at UESTC, focusing on multimodal image fusion tasks.<br>

I am currently seeking Phd (or research assistant) opportunities in **Machine Learning, Data Mining, or Multimodal Studies**. 

I have a strong interest and motivation for research work. If any collaboration opportunities are available, I would be eager to discuss further. Please contact me at [xujian.0426@std.uestc.edu.cn](mailto:xujian.0426@std.uestc.edu.cn).<br>
