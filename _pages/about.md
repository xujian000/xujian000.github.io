I obtained a master's degree in **Communication and Information Systems** from the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China**. <br>

I have over three years of experience as a software development engineer in the tech industry, having previously worked at [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/) and [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/).

I am currently **seeking unpaid remote research assistant opportunities** in Machine Learning, Data Mining, or Multimodal studies. <br>

I have a strong interest and motivation for research work. I have excellent coding skills and can quickly implement ideas and engineering solutions. In the past several months, I have worked as a research assistant at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, focusing on multimodal image fusion tasks.<br>
