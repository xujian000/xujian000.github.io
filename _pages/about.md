Hello, my name is Xu Jian. I am a graduate from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, where I studied Communication and Information Systems. 

I have over three years of experience as a software development engineer in the tech industry, having previously worked at [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/) and [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/).
I also have several months of experience as a research assistant, during which I focused on multimodal image fusion tasks at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

I am currently seeking remote research assistant opportunities in Machine Learning, Data Mining, or Multimodal studies. I possess strong coding skills and can quickly implement ideas and engineering solutions. 
If you are in need of a research assistant, I would be very eager to discuss potential collaboration with you. Please feel free to contact me.
